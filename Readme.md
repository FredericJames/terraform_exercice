## Infrastructure documentation

The infrastructure is fully based on GCP.
Multiple services are leverage:
 - cloud sql (postgres)
 - cloud run (both frontend and api)
 - vertex ai (endpoint + model)
 - IAM serviceaccount

Limitations taken into account for this exercice:
 - Time and cost
   - time: new to gcp, a lot to learn, so needs to be efficient
   - cost: free trial
 - api open to reach it from the outside, normally only the frontend and a specific role (for dev/test purpose) would have access to it
 - No knowledge on reactjs
 - Found no way to deploy a model on an endpoint through the official google provider
